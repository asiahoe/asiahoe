## Hello There!

Iâ€™m a multidisciplinary product designer with 15+ years of experience. I team up with mission-driven startups, small businesses, enterprises, and non-profits alike to craft delightful, inclusive, and accessible digital experiences.

Using skills across the UX Design, User Research, and Front-End Web Development disciplines, Iâ€™ve helped launch websites, mobile apps, and design systems. When I'm not designing, I am an avid gamer, reader, and writer who never stops learning.
